# Introduction
Modern bulk power systems are developing into AC-DC hybrid systems with high penetration of renewables. There has been a lack of representative benchmarks to study stability and security problems of modern power systems. This project is an attempt to provide a set of four test models, addressing problems of voltage stability, rotor angle stability, frequency stability, and power frequency overvoltage under large disturbance. On the four stability/security problems, the models consider both their conventional features and distinct features induced by renewables. All the data of the models are extracted from real power systems, with modifications to establish a near-future scenario with over 50% renewable penetration. The test models are proposed by China Electric Power Research Institute, and acknowledged by Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering (CSEE). They are expected to serve educators, researchers and practitioners in related areas.

Enclosed with the data is a paper that describes main features of the test systems, as well as a supporting document providing main parameters and simulation results of the test systems. The paper is currently under review in IEEE Transactions on Power Systems. 

All data in the project are in BPA format. For anyone who does not have BPA software, he/she can view the original data as .txt files. Some researchers are developing the test systems in other platforms, as can be seen from the enclosed paper.
